End to End multi-class dog breed classification

This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

**1. Problem** </br>
Identifiy the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

**2. Data** </br>
Data we are using from kagle https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data

**3. Evaluation** </br>
The evaluation is a file with prediciton probabilites for each dog breed of each test image.

**4. Features** </br>
We are dealing with unstructured data(Image). So we will use deep learning, transfer learning.
There are around 10000+ training image in training set(These images has labels) There are around 10000+ images in test set(These images has no labels, because we want to predict them)
